# Lab material

NOTE: it is possible to accomplish every lab **without** having to buy all this material. You only need a Unix-like machine, such as a GNU/Linux OS with GCC installed, or, for Windows user, some virtual environment such as Cygwin, Unix shell for windows, or Mingw.

If you want to "play" with some hardware, here is a minimal list of items you might want to buy. 

- An embedded computer, such as a STM IoT Node (from the Electronics course), or a Raspberry Pi computer, with 2/4GB of RAM: approx 40-60€
  - [Model B with 2 GB RAM](https://www.kubii.it/raspberry-pi-3-2-b/2771-nuovo-raspberry-pi-4-modello-b-2gb-0765756931175.html)
  - [Model B with 4GB RAM](https://www.kubii.it/raspberry-pi-3-2-b/2772-nuovo-raspberry-pi-4-modello-b-4gb-0765756931182.html)
  - You can power it using a standard USB (C, in this case) cable connected to your laptop. You shouldn't even need to buy the charger (which is however around 8-9€) - [link1]( https://it.rs-online.com/web/p/alimentatori-per-raspberry-pi/1873417?cm_mmc=IT-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_IT_IT_no_category_Whoop-_-(IT:Whoop!)+No+Category-_-1873417&matchtype=&pla-336315895108&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dD7BRASEiwAWCtCb55-ko43QB-6WPrZ9DSF0vfua134F6bUGekjSl7FpRZ9so9DH0aSFRoC1HQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - [link2]( https://www.kubii.it/caricabatterie-alimentatori-raspberry/2678-alimentatore-ufficiale-153w-usb-c-per-raspberry-pi-4-3272496300002.html)
  - You can access to the Pi from your laptop via Ethernet/SSH, so you won't need to use keyboards nor screens, besides for the first set up. Please, feel free to use the lab ones for this.
  - Also, the Pi3 is fine
- 8GB (at least) SD card, approx 10€ [link]( https://www.kubii.it/schede-sd-storage/2159-scheda-microsd-8gb-classe-10-transcend-kubii-3272496010529.html)
- Very basic prototyping kit for makers (you can share it - approx 10€) - [link](https://www.kubii.it/kit-di-componenti/1947-pack-di-componenti-elettrici-kubii-3272496007925.html)
